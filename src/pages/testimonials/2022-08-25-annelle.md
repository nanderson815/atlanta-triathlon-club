The group training sessions help me achieve my goal of completing an Olympic distance triathlon. The coaches and team members are all supportive, and even pushes me toward achieving higher goals (i.e. 70.3 ironman). Coach Allison guided me to swim more efficiently and overcome my anxiety in open water. Coach Nicole patiently taught me how to get on my bike, transition to clip on shoes, and cycle with the group in Cartersville; which gave me more confidence to cycle longer distances and get over my fear of falling.
