Atlanta Triathlon Club has been so instrumental in encouraging me and helping me train for my first Ironman. Everyone is so knowledgeable and kind. They are quick to answer my questions, even the silly ones. I trained with Coach Nicole and she is excellent!! She believes in me even when I doubt my abilities. She was my Sag for 8hrs as I completed my first century ride. I couldnâ€™t have accomplished this feat without her. I 100% recommend Atlanta Triathlon Club and Coach Nicole if you are trying to accomplish your first triathlon or your 10th triathlon. They are knowledgeable and will help you get faster and ready for your next event.
