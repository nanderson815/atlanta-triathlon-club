The coaches, group activities, specialists, and support have been a critical part of helping me achieve my training and racing goals. There's so much conflicting information available it's very very helpful to have their expertise helping me sift through the "noise" in order to identify the priorities and focus on them. I have been a coached athlete for almost two years and I do not believe I could have made the progress I made any other way. I am very thankful for the team at Energy Lab and am very proud of what I have achieved with their guidance and support.
