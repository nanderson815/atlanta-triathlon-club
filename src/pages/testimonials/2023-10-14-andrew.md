The Energy Lab coaches have been instrumental in not only helping me get faster, but more importantly, making the sport of triathlon more fulfilling. It's not just about tailoring weekly workouts specifically for me â€” although that is a huge help! I have learned so much about nutrition and recovery from my coach, which has helped me avoid injury, stay healthy, have better races, and have more fun!
