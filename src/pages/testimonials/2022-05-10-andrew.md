Working one-on-one with an Energy Lab coach has been a phenomenal experience. Nicole's detail-oriented training plans and enthusiastic optimism have helped me set and achieve new goals in both running and triathlon. Most importantly to me, Nicole always keeps perspective that this is a hobby - not a job - and it's supposed to be fun!
