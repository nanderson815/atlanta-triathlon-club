The Atlanta Triathlon Club coaches are certified masters at their craft. I started with the club, not knowing how to swim, but was an avid cyclist, and an occasional, non-long distance runner. Coaches Ed, Allison and Tim have helped me achieve many goals, including swimming half-Ironman distances, becoming an even stronger cyclist, and running with an endurance mindset. I have even bigger goals that will be achieved with the support from ATC.
