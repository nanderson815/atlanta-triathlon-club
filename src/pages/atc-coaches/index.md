      Sara Scott
      Energy Lab Indoor Cycling Instructor
    about: >-
      Sara Scott is a USA Triathlon Level 1 Certified Coach, with a passion for
      helping individuals of all experience levels achieve their goals. Sara
      grew up playing soccer, tennis and golf, and started running as a way to
      socialize outside of work when she moved to Fort Worth, Texas after
      college. It was while on vacation in St Croix, she happened to witness the
      famous 70.3 race held there, and somehow found the audacity to register
      for the Chattanooga Olympic triathlon, though not owning a bike or having
      any idea how to actually train (or even swim). It was a delightful and
      harrowing experience, which she immediately decided that she would do it
      again the following year, and soon found herself at an Atlanta Triathlon
      Club Info Session. 


      Sara has completed five Ironman Distance races, including Challenge Roth, and dozens of Half, Olympic and Sprint distance events, and she did return to tackle that St Croix race. As an active member of the Atlanta Triathlon Club, she joined the coaching staff as a leader for outdoor long rides, managed club social events for a couple seasons, and also leads indoor cycling as an instructor at Energy Lab. 


      In addition to Level 1 USAT Coach, she also holds a 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training Certification. After 20+ years of innovation experience within the food & beverage industry, Sara has evolved from the corporate world and into her passion of coaching and lifelong learning. She is currently enrolled in Athlete-Specific Yoga Teacher Training, as is looking forward to completing her Health and Wellness Coaching certification training in 2021. Sara lives on the south side of Atlanta and also escapes to the North GA mountains as often as possible with her bikes, her husband Dusty & their hounds, Cooper & Banjo.
