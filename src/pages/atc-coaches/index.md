      Lucy has been a member of ATC since 2021 and will embark on her first year
      of coaching in 2025. Growing up in an active family, Lucy has been
      involved in sports from a young age. Her journey into running began in
      2018 after graduating college, when she couldn’t afford a gym membership.
      What started as a cheap way to stay fit quickly turned into a passion.
      Despite initially struggling to run for more than 10 minutes, she signed
      up for her first 5k and never looked back!


      Joining the club in 2021, Lucy was immediately captivated by the challenging and exhilarating nature of triathlons. Since then, she has completed two 70.3 Ironman races and numerous road races, ranging from 5k to full marathons.


      As someone who took up running as an adult, Lucy takes pride in helping others who are also starting from scratch. She loves witnessing athletes discover their competitive spirit and push themselves to achieve their full potential. Lucy believes that while crossing the finish line is an individual accomplishment, the journey to get there is a collective effort.

      Brandy grew up playing soccer competitively for the Olympic Development
      Team, Oklahoma State and Mississippi State Universities.  After hanging up
      her soccer cleats, she spent the next several years trying different
      recreational sports.  When she saw an Ironman race on TV, she was
      intrigued. A year later a co-worker asked if she’d ever considered
      triathlons and gave her a bike. That was all the motivation she needed to
      dip her toes in the water.  It was love at first race!


      As soon as she finished her first sprint race, she knew she needed community to learn from and joined ATC in 2018. Over the ensuing years she’s completed sprint, Olympic and 70.3 distance races as well as 1 marathon. Her preferred race is Olympic distance.

    about: >-
      Sara Scott is a USA Triathlon Level 1 Certified Coach, with a passion for
      helping individuals of all experience levels achieve their goals. Sara
      grew up playing soccer, tennis and golf, and started running as a way to
      socialize outside of work when she moved to Fort Worth, Texas after
      college. It was while on vacation in St Croix, she happened to witness the
      famous 70.3 race held there, and somehow found the audacity to register
      for the Chattanooga Olympic triathlon, though not owning a bike or having
      any idea how to actually train (or even swim). It was a delightful and
      harrowing experience, which she immediately decided that she would do it
      again the following year, and soon found herself at an Atlanta Triathlon
      Club Info Session. 


      Sara has completed five Ironman Distance races, including Challenge Roth, and dozens of Half, Olympic and Sprint distance events, and she did return to tackle that St Croix race. As an active member of the Atlanta Triathlon Club, she joined the coaching staff as a leader for outdoor long rides, managed club social events for a couple seasons, and also leads indoor cycling as an instructor at Energy Lab. 


      In addition to Level 1 USAT Coach, she also holds a 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training Certification. After 20+ years of innovation experience within the food & beverage industry, Sara has evolved from the corporate world and into her passion of coaching and lifelong learning. She is currently enrolled in Athlete-Specific Yoga Teacher Training, as is looking forward to completing her Health and Wellness Coaching certification training in 2021. Sara lives on the south side of Atlanta and also escapes to the North GA mountains as often as possible with her bikes, her husband Dusty & their hounds, Cooper & Banjo.
