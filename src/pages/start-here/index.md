  - title: SWIMMING
    desc: >-
      We offer three to four, organized coach- led practices during the week
      with up to five lanes at a practice. Lanes are organized by
      ability—newbies and former-college-swimmers welcome.


      Just learning to swim? We have a dedicated beginner lane at our Monday night sessions for that. All our practices are beginner friendly. And we offer swim lessons through Energy Lab if you need extra one on one attention. Two to three times per month during summer we offer supported open water sessions at Red Top Mountain in Cartersville.
  - title: CYCLING
    desc: >-
      We have plenty of indoor and outdoor riding options. At Energy Lab, our
      dedicated power cycling studio, you can either ride your own bike with one
      of our computrainers or ride one of our standalone cycleops bikes—where
      all you need is your shoes. Train with power or heart rate? We offer
      performance testing once per month to help you keep your zones current.


      On summer Thursday nights, we ride hill repeats in Buckhead, with optional pizza and beer afterwards at Fellinis. And on the weekends, we have supported long rides at various popular locations in the summer, and Energy Lab studio rides in the winter. New to group rides? You’ll be paired with others going a similar distance and speed so you don’t have to ride alone!
  - title: RUNNING
    desc: We run in Buckhead on Tuesday nights and a seasonal Track workout at The
      Active Oval in Piedmont Park on Thursday Mornings.  On the weekends, we
      have supported group runs that rotate locations around and outside
      Atlanta. You will be paired with others running a similar distance and
      pace.
