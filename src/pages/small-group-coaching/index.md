Train for your first—or best—sprint triathlon.

A coach isn't just for experienced athletes. In fact, beginners are the group most likely to benefit from the guidance of a coach. Join us! This program is designed for athletes newer to triathlon who have never been coached.

Start by applying today so we can learn more about your goals. The price for the membership is a $150/month.

This season we will offer two target races. The GA Peach Women's Sprint & The Don Carter Park Sprint. Women starting triathlon will have the opportunity in racing a women’s only sprint.                                               

Our next round of four month coaching starts on April 1, 2024
