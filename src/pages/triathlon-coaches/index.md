    about: >-
      Sara Scott is a USA Triathlon Level 1 Certified Coach, with a passion for
      helping individuals of all experience levels achieve their goals. Sara
      grew up playing soccer, tennis and golf, and started running as a way to
      socialize outside of work when she moved to Fort Worth, Texas after
      college. It was while on vacation in St Croix, she happened to witness the
      famous 70.3 race held there, and somehow found the audacity to register
      for the Chattanooga Olympic triathlon, though not owning a bike or having
      any idea how to actually train (or even swim). It was a delightful and
      harrowing experience, which she immediately decided that she would do it
      again the following year, and soon found herself at an Atlanta Triathlon
      Club Info Session. 


      Sara has completed five Ironman Distance races, including Challenge Roth, and dozens of Half, Olympic and Sprint distance events, and she did return to tackle that St Croix race. As an active member of the Atlanta Triathlon Club, she joined the coaching staff as a leader for outdoor long rides, managed club social events for a couple seasons, and also leads indoor cycling as an instructor at Energy Lab. 


      In addition to Level 1 USAT Coach, she also holds a 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training Certification. After 20+ years of innovation experience within the food & beverage industry, Sara has evolved from the corporate world and into her passion of coaching and lifelong learning. She is currently enrolled in Athlete-Specific Yoga Teacher Training, as is looking forward to completing her Health and Wellness Coaching certification training in 2021. Sara lives on the south side of Atlanta and also escapes to the North GA mountains as often as possible with her bikes, her husband Dusty & their hounds, Cooper & Banjo.

    about: >-
      Ed grew up playing football and baseball but eventually grew into
      endurance sports with cycling and triathlon. He has completed multiple
      short and long distance triathlons as well as gravel bike races. Inspired
      by his own coaches and teammates Ed became a USAT certified coach and has
      been actively coaching athletes for 4+ years.


      Ed has coached a wide range of athletes ranging from single sport cyclists and runners to triathletes completing all distances. He loves data and finding new ways to analyze it to improve performance over time. Ed was also the General Manager for All3sports. There he learned a lot about the gear needed not only to get started in the sport, but also to progress quickly to hit goals. Keeping up with the changing technology he has worked with and prescribed both cycling and run power based workouts.


      Outside of coaching you will find Ed chasing his two young toddlers around. He is hoping they will soon be jumping on the bike and starting their own endurance journey soon!

      runner and triathlete, and physical therapist. She received her triathlon
      coaching certification in 2020 and started coaching through her physical

      gained experience with beginner triathletes competing in short distance

      Steph has been competing in triathlons and running events of various distances for 10 years. She considers running her best event and that of which she is most knowledgeable. Until college, she only ran to stay in shape for competitive volleyball and softball. Steph always knew she was different when she actually preferred the “punishment” known as running over actually playing the sport! She continued to recreationally swim, bike, and run in college, then completed her first sprint triathlon in 2012 upon moving to Atlanta for physical therapy school. After getting bored with solo training, she finally joined the Atlanta Triathlon Club in 2016 and has been a member since then. Eventually, she drank the kool aid and signed up for her first full Ironman triathlon, leading her to join the Energy Lab team in 2018. 


      Steph received her Bachelor of Science degree in exercise science from Florida State University in 2011, and went on to earn her Doctorate in Physical Therapy from Emory University in 2015. She started her career at Benchmark Physical Therapy in Lawrenceville, Georgia in 2015 while also completing her residency in orthopedics in 2017. She then served as the clinic director for two years at Benchmark’s Stone Mountain, Georgia location. In 2019, Steph earned her specialty in orthopedic physical therapy and began practicing at Motion Stability. She enjoys being able to work with patients one-on-one, and has a special interest in endurance athletes. She also treats basic post-operative, chronic pain, non-sports injury, and vestibular conditions. 


      Steph looks forward to combining her expertise in orthopedic physical therapy, knowledge of biomechanics and running form, experience as an endurance athlete, and triathlon coaching education to optimally train and work with beginner and intermediate triathletes. She plans to incorporate injury prevention and act as a resource for injured athletes as well.
